        "Cursor is at least a 2x improvement over Copilot. It's amazing having an AI pair programmer, and is an incredible accelerator for me and my team. - Ben Bernard, Instacart",
        "The Cursor tab completion while coding is occasionally so magic it defies reality - about ~25% of the time it is anticipating exactly what I want to do. It is enough to make you believe that eventually you'll be able to code at the speed of thought. - Kevin Whinnery, OpenAI",
        "Cursor is hands down my biggest workflow improvement in years - Sawyer Hood, Figma",
        "I love writing code and Cursor is a necessity. Cursor is steps ahead of my brain, proposing multi-line edits so I type 'tab' more than anything else. - Andrew Milich, Notion",
        "Cursor is so good, and literally gets better/more feature-rich every couple of weeks. - Morgan McGuire, Weights & Biases",
        "Cursor is awesome! Someone finally put GPT into a code editor in a seamless way. It's so elegant and easy. No more copying and pasting. I'm an hour in and already hooked. - Andrew McCalip, Varda",
        "Cursor is the best AI developer tool right now, avoid it at your own peril - Logan Kilpatrick, Google",
        "Started using Cursor yesterday & i'm blown away. it's how Copilot should feel. i'm completely off VSCode now. - Sam Whitmore, New Computer",
        "Cursor is the best product I've used in a while - it's an AI enabled editor. I just asked it to write a README for a project I've been working on - analyzed the code-base and worked first time. - Alex MacCaw, Reflect",
        "Gonna apply to YC and list Cursor as my cofounder - Cory Etzkorn, Notion",
        "Cursor's new auto-complete is insane. You no longer need to prompt it. It predicts what code you want based on what you're doing. Accept by hitting tab. - Marc Köhlbrugge, WIP",
        "I really like how Cursor suggests edits to existing code. It noticed I was inconsistent with my markup and popped up this suggestion that matched my other items! - Wes Bos",
        "Cursor is 🐐-ed for real - Steven Tey, Dub",
        "The most useful AI tool that I currently pay for is, hands down, is Cursor. It's fast, autocompletes when and where you need it to, handles brackets properly, sensible keyboard shortcuts, bring-your-own-model...everything is well put together. - shadcn, Vercel",
        "I went from never hearing about Cursor to many IC engineers telling me it's their new favorite tool. Seemingly overnight! Pretty wild product-market fit. - Josh Miller, The Browser Company",
        "I installed Cursor ... oh - Kent C. Dodds",
        "After many recommendations, I finally switched from VSC to Cursor and ... wow! It's absolutely incredible. If you like Copilot (or if you don't), you'll be blown away by Cursor. There is no going back. 🤯 - Johannes Schickling, Prisma"

Agents can read the thread, understand what's going on, and create PRs in GitHub, all without leaving the conversation.\n\n### Use Cursor where your team works\n\nMention **@Cursor** in any thread with a prompt like:\n\n![Using @Cursor in Slack](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslack-zoomed.4d0262cc.gif&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAgents run remotely in a secure environment and you'll get updates directly in Slack, including links to Cursor and GitHub, when the work is done.\n\n### Agents understand context\n\nCursor reads the entire Slack thread before starting, so Background Agents understand the full context when you reference previous discussions or issues.\n\n![View PR link in Slack](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslack-view-pr.05c38101.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nYou can also ask Cursor to investigate issues and get answers:\n\n![Cursor agent investigating in Slack](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslack-investigate.2320d781.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Getting started\n\nTo use Background Agents in Slack, an admin needs to set up the integration first. Check out our [setup documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/slack) or ask your workspace admin to connect Cursor from the [Dashboard → Integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations) page.\n\nOnce connected, try it in any channel with **@Cursor** and write a prompt. Use the command `help` to see all commands, or `settings` to configure your default model, repo, and branch.\n\nImprovements (1)\n\n- Search in settings with `Cmd/Ctrl+F`\n\nMCP (3)\n\n- Progress notifications from servers\n- Dynamic tool registration\n- Roots supports\n\nPatches (3)\n\n**1.1.1**\n\n- Fixed workspaces indexing issue\n\n**1.1.2**\n\n- Improved client side performance\n\n**1.1.3**\n\n- Fixed MCP performance regression\n- Added PR search and indexing\n- Improved deeplink experience\n- Added option to change upstream marketplace provider\n\n**1.1.4**\n\n- Improved Background Agent reliability\n- Fixed search in Chat UI bug\n\n**1.1.5**\n\n- Small performance improvements\n\n**1.1.6**\n\n- Fixed an agent latency regression that occurs for users using Remote SSH\n\n1.0\n\nJune 4, 2025\n\n1.0\n\n## [BugBot, Background Agent access to everyone, and one-click MCP install](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/1-0)\n\nCursor 1.0 is here!\n\nThis release brings BugBot for code review, a first look at memories, one-click MCP setup, Jupyter support, and general availability of Background Agent.\n\n### Automatic code review with BugBot\n\nBugBot automatically reviews your PRs and catches potential bugs and issues.\n\nWhen an issue is found, BugBot leaves a comment on your PRs in GitHub. You can click \" _**Fix in Cursor**_\" to move back to the editor with a pre-filled prompt to fix the issue.\n\nTo set it up, follow instructions in our [BugBot docs](https://docs.cursor.com/bugbot).\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Background Agent for everyone\n\nSince we released Background Agent, our remote coding agent, in early access a few weeks ago, early signals have been positive.\n\nWe're now excited to expand Background Agent to all users! You can start using it right away by clicking the cloud icon in chat or hitting `Cmd/Ctrl+E` if you have privacy mode disabled. For users with privacy mode enabled, we'll soon have a way to enable it for you too!\n\n![Background Agent in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fbg-agent.349d715a.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Agent in Jupyter Notebooks\n\nCursor can now implement changes in Jupyter Notebooks!\n\nAgent will now create and edit multiple cells directly inside of Jupyter, a significant improvement for research and data science tasks. Only supported with Sonnet models to start.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Memories\n\nWith Memories, Cursor can remember facts from conversations and reference them in the future. Memories are stored per project on an individual level, and can be managed from Settings.\n\nWe're rolling out Memories as a beta feature. To get started, enable from Settings → Rules.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### MCP one-click install and OAuth support\n\nYou can now set up MCP servers in Cursor with one click, and together with OAuth support, you can easily authenticate servers that support it.\n\nWe've curated a short list of official MCP servers you can add to Cursor at [docs.cursor.com/tools](https://docs.cursor.com/tools).\n\nIf you're an MCP developer, you can easily make your server available to developers by adding a _Add to Cursor_ button in your documentation and READMEs. Generate one at [docs.cursor.com/deeplinks](https://docs.cursor.com/deeplinks).\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Richer Chat responses\n\nCursor can now render visualizations inside of a conversation. In particular, Mermaid diagrams and Markdown tables can now be generated and viewed in the same place!\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### New Settings and Dashboard\n\nThe setting and dashboard page have gotten some polish with this release.\n\nWith the new Dashboard, you can view your individual or team's usage analytics, update your display name, and view detailed statistics broken down by tool or model.\n\n![Settings in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsettings.2dea9c3d.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![Dashboard in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdashboard.2b7002bf.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nKeyboard (1)\n\n- Open Background Agent control panel with `Cmd/Ctrl+E`\n\nImprovements (4)\n\n- `@Link` and web search can now parse PDFs and include in context\n- Network diagnostics in settings to verify connectivity\n- Faster responses with parallel tool calls\n- Collapsable tool calls in Chat\n\nAccount (3)\n\n- Enterprise users can only access stable release (no pre-release)\n- Team admins can now disable Privacy Mode\n- [Admin API for teams](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/admin-api) to access usage metrics and spend data\n\nModels (1)\n\n- Max mode is now available for Gemini 2.5 Flash\n\nPatches (1)\n\n**1.0.1**\n\n- Fixes and improvements to Background Agent\n\n0.50\n\nMay 15, 2025\n\n0.50\n\n## [Simplified Pricing, Background Agent and Refreshed Inline Edit](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/0-50)\n\nIntroducing unified request-based pricing, Max Mode for all top models, and Background Agent for parallel task execution. Plus, improved context management with `@folders` support, refreshed Inline Edit with new options, faster file edits, multi-root workspace support, and enhanced chat features including export and duplication.\n\n### Simpler, unified pricing\n\nWe've heard your feedback and are rolling out a unified pricing model to make it less confusing. Here's how it works:\n\n- All model usage is now unified into request-based pricing\n- Max mode now uses token-based pricing (similar to how models API pricing works)\n- Premium tool calls and long context mode are removed to keep it simple\n\nQuotas on [plans](https://www.cursor.com/pricing) Hobby, Pro and Business has not changed and slow requests are still included in the plans. All usage can be found in your [dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard) to help you track and manage your spend.\n\n### Max Mode for all top models\n\nMax Mode is now available for all state-of-the-art models in Cursor, with a simpler token-based pricing model. It's designed to give you full control when you need it most. You can enable it from the model picker to see which models support it. When new models roll out, Max Mode will be how we deliver their full capabilities from day one.\n\nIt's ideal for your hardest problems when you need more context, intelligence and tool use. For everything else, normal mode is still recommended with the same capabilities you're used to.\n\nThe pricing is straightforward: you're charged based on token usage. If you've used any CLI-based coding tool, Max mode will feel like that - but right in Cursor.\n\n> Note: If you're using an older version of Cursor, you'll still have access to the previous MAX versions and long context mode for a few weeks. However, these features will be sunset soon, so we recommend updating to continue using these capabilities.\n\nRead more about Max Mode in our [documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/max-mode)\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### New Tab model\n\nWe've trained a new Tab model that now can suggest changes across multiple files. The model excels particularly at refactors, edit chains, multi file changes, and jumping between related code. You'll also notice it feels more natural and snappier in day-to-day use.\n\nWith this we've also added syntax highlighting to the completion suggestions.\n\n![New Tab model in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftab-jump.d0319f16.png&w=2880&q=75)\n\n### Background Agent  Preview\n\nIn early preview, rolling out gradually: Cursor agents can now run in the background! To try it, head to Settings > Beta > Background Agent.\n\nThis allows you to run many agents in parallel and have them tackle bigger tasks. The agents run in their own remote environments. At any point, you can view the status, send a follow-up, or take over.\n\nWe're curious to hear what you think. While it is still early, we've found background agents useful internally for fixing nits, doing investigations, and writing first drafts of medium-sized PRs. Read more at [docs.cursor.com/background-agent](https://docs.cursor.com/background-agent).\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Include your entire codebase in context\n\nYou can now use `@folders` to add your entire codebase into context, just make sure to enable `Full folder contents` from settings. If a folder (or file) is too large to be included, you'll see a small icon on the context pill indicating this.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Refreshed Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K) with Agent integration\n\nInline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K) has gotten a UI refresh and new options for full file edits (⌘⇧⏎) and sending to agent (⌘L)\n\nFull file makes it easy to do scope changes to a file without using agent. However, you might come across cases where you're working with a piece of code you want to make multi-file edits to or simply just want more control you can get from agent. That's when you want to send selected codeblock to agent and keep on editing from there.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Fast edits for long files with Agent\n\nWe've added a new tool to the agent that will search & replace code in files, making it much more efficient for long files. Instead of reading the complete file, Agent can now find the exact place where edits should occur and change only that part. Here's an example editing a file in [Postgres codebase](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/tcop/postgres.c) where using search & replace tool is nearly double as fast. We're rolling this out to Anthropic models first and will expand to other models soon.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Work in multiple codebases with workspaces\n\nNow you can create multi-root workspaces to make multiple codebases available to Cursor. All of them will be indexed and available to Cursor, ideal when you have projects in different folders you want to work on in the same space.\n\n`.cursor/rules` are supported in all folders added\n\n![Multi-root workspaces in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fworkspace.90fbcb7b.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Working with Chat\n\n#### Exporting Chat\n\nYou can now export chats to markdown from the chat view. Text and code blocks are included in the final export.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n#### Duplicate Chats\n\nExploring different paths from a conversation while preserving the existing is now possible with chat duplication. Go to a message and start a new chat from the three dots menu.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nKeybindings (1)\n\n- Full file edits from Inline Edit: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+K`\n\nImprovements (11)\n\n- Agent now uses native terminal emulation instead of simulated terminals\n- `@folders` will now try to include all files that fit in context\n- Icons for context state in Chat to tell you if files were not included or condensed\n- Individual MCP tools can now be disabled from MCP settings\n- New C# extension available in marketplace\n- Chat font size can now be increased in settings\n- Detailed in-app changelog\n\n**MCP**\n\n- Run stdio from remote workspace (WSL, Remote SSH)\n- Streamable HTTP support\n- Fixed leaking SSE server connections\n- More reliable refreshing when changing config\n\nAccount (1)\n\n- Removed 10 free requests/day for Claude 3 Opus\n\nPatches (7)\n\n**0.50.1**\n\n- Background Agent availability\n\n**0.50.2**\n\n- Fixed keyboard navigation in Jupyter notebooks\n- Fixed Custom mode models MAX and selection issues\n- Improved indexing reliability for single-root workspaces\n- Fixed VPN reliability with ZScaler\n\n**0.50.3**\n\n- Performance improvements\n\n**0.50.4**\n\n- Improved apply reliability\n- Fixed Windows horizontal scrolling bug\n- MCP improvements\n- Improved multiroot workspace support\n\n**0.50.5**\n\n- Fixed chat pill not updating when switching files\n\n**0.50.6**\n\n- Fixed search & replace reliability issues\n- Fixed checkpoint reliability issues\n- Improved indexing\n- Improved Python extension\n\n**0.50.7**\n\n- Fixed search & replace bug for Windows\n\n0.49\n\nApril 15, 2025\n\n0.49\n\n## [Rules generation, improved agent terminal and MCP images](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/0-49)\n\n### Automated and improved rules\n\nYou can now generate rules directly from a conversation using the `/Generate Cursor Rules` command. This is useful when you want to capture the existing context of a conversation to reuse later.\n\nFor `Auto Attached` rules with path patterns defined, Agent will now automatically apply the right rules when reading or writing files\n\nWe’ve also fixed a long-standing issue where `Always` attached rules now persist across longer conversations. Agent can now also edit rules reliably.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### More accessible history\n\nChat history has moved into the command palette. You can access it from the \"Show history button\" in Chat as well as through the `Show Chat History` command\n\n![Chat history](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchat-history.99f0dd79.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Making reviews easier\n\nReviewing agent generated code is now easier with a built-in diff view at the end of each conversation. You'll find the `Review changes` button at the bottom of chat after a message from the agent.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Images in MCP\n\nYou can now pass images as part of the context in MCP servers. This helps when screenshots, UI mocks, or diagrams add essential context to a question or prompt.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Improved agent terminal control\n\nWe've added more control for you over terminals started by the agent. Commands can now be edited before they run, or skipped entirely. We've also renamed \"Pop-out\" to \"Move to background\" to better reflect what it does.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Global ignore files\n\nYou can now define [global ignore](https://docs.cursor.com/context/ignore-files) patterns that apply across all projects via your user-level settings. This keeps noisy or sensitive files like build outputs or secrets out of prompts, without needing per-project configuration.\n\n![Global ignore files](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fignore-files.f9e4d0f0.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### New models\n\nWe've recently added many more [models](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models) you can use. Try out Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, GPT-4.1, o3 and o4-mini from model settings.\n\n![Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgemini-2.5.8414d83f.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![Grok 3](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgrok-3.5db31a7e.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![GPT-4.1](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgpt-4.1.cfcf0933.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![o3 & o4-mini](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fo3-o4-mini.607b4179.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Project structure in context  Beta\n\nWe’re introducing an option to include project structure in context, which adds your directory structure to the prompt. The agent now gets a clearer sense of how your project is organized, which improves suggestions and navigation of large or nested monorepos.\n\nKeybindings (2)\n\n- Some `CMD+K` shortcuts are now remappable\n- Emacs keybinding extensions now work reliably\n\nImprovements (5)\n\n- Simplified model picker UI for Auto-select\n- New interface for command palette\n- Refreshed UI for Tab jump suggestions. Suggestions outside viewport are now clickable\n- Tooltips for modes in Chat\n- MCP stability\n- You can now connect to AWS Bedrock using access keys and secret keys\n- Git > @PR has now been renamed to @Branch\n\nFixes (4)\n\n- Always-attached rules now persist correctly across summarization\n- Rules in `.mdc` files can now be created and edited without issue by agent\n- Fixed selection issues with `@mention` nodes at the start of the input box\n- Performance in core editor\n\nBusiness / Teams (4)\n\n**Global ignore traversal**\n\n- Cursor can now traverse up directory trees to find ignore files. This behavior is off by default and can be enabled from admin settings.\n\n**IAM roles for Bedrock**\n\n- Enterprises can now connect to AWS Bedrock using IAM roles\n\n**User-level usage insights**\n\n- Admins can now view per-user spend and fast request usage directly from the dashboard.\n\n**Auto-run controls for teams**\n\n- Admins can configure global MCP settings from dashboard.\n\nPatches (6)\n\n**0.49.1**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Fixed Cursor Rules editor for Remote SSH\n- Fixed UI delimiter display in zsh terminal in Chat\n- Fixed \"max length\" warning showing incorrectly for rules under size limit\n- Fixed \"message too large\" warning appearing in empty chats\n\n**0.49.2**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Improved rule generation apply\n- Improved caching for user prompts\n- Improved client metric handling\n\n**0.49.3**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Fixed issue with loading chat\n\n**0.49.4**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Fixed Neovim chat keybindings\n- Improved indexing debug logs\n- Fixed `.cursorignore` issue preventing chat submission on Windows\n\n**0.49.5**\n\n- Improved client reliability\n\n**0.49.6**\n\n- Fixed possibly broken codeblocks in old chats\n- Fixed loading state issue in old chats\n- Fixed chat message rendering issue\n- Improved folders parsing\n\n0.48.x\n\nMarch 23, 2025\n\n0.48.x\n\n## [Chat tabs, Custom modes & Faster indexing](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/chat-tabs-custom-modes-sound-notification)\n\nThis release introduces chat tabs for parallel conversations, a redesigned\nmodes system with custom modes, and improvements to cost visibility, indexing\nperformance, and MCP reliability. Additionally, a sound notification plays when a chat is finished\n\n### Built-in modes & custom modes (beta)\n\nAgent and Ask modes are the built-in modes in Cursor, now with the option to add custom modes. We've also renamed \"Edit\" to \"Manual\" to better reflect its behavior.\n\nAsk mode now has access to all search tools by default, so the `@Codebase` tool has been removed. It will automatically search the codebase when needed. If you want to force a search, simply ask Cursor in natural language to \"search the codebase\". You can disable search from Ask in the mode menu, which will result in Ask only seeing the context you have provided.\n\nRead more about [Agent](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent) and [Ask](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/ask).\n\n![Modes](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmodes.e9d94bd5.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Custom modes** (beta) allow you to compose new modes with tools and prompts that fit your workflow. Since custom modes can have custom keybindings, **⌘I will default to Agent mode** and **⌘L** will toggle the side pane. If you unbind ⌘I, it will also toggle the side pane. Custom modes are currently in beta, and you can enable them from Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes.\n\nYou can also set the default mode from settings (Settings → Features → Chat → Default chat mode) to one of your modes or to the one you used most recently.\n\nRead more about [custom modes](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes).\n\n![custom modes](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcustom-modes.ea111789.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Chat tabs\n\nCreate new tabs (⌘T) in chat to have multiple conversations in parallel. You can also hold Option and click the + button to create a new tab. Cmd+N still creates a new chat in the current tab\n\nWhen a tab is awaiting your input, you'll see an orange dot on that tab.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Faster indexing\n\nWe've made significant improvements to indexing performance of similar codebases within a team, greatly reducing the initial indexing time for subsequent copies of large repositories after one copy has been fully indexed. For example, the Cursor codebase now indexes in under a minute, previously taking around 20 minutes.\n\n### Sound notification (beta)\n\nCursor can now play a sound when a chat is ready for review. Enable this feature from Settings → Features → Chat → Play sound on finish.\n\n### Usage-based cost visibility\n\nFor usage-based models, you can now view the cost and breakdown per chat from the history.\n\n![Cost visibility](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchat-cost.a1f3f4d2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### New onboarding\n\nWe've introduced an easier onboarding process to help you get started with Cursor. You'll be guided through importing settings, selecting themes, keybindings, and other preferences.\n\n![onboarding](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fonboarding.5ec6e148.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOther (6)\n\n- Improved indexing performance for teams sharing codebases\n- The vertical sidebar option will temporarily be unavailable for users who opted into Early Access\n- Projects with MCP servers will now prompt users to enable them\n- Chat will now display a notification about usage-based pricing when approaching fast request or usage limits\n- Enhanced visibility of auto-run controls configured by team admins, clarifying when they are active\n- Removed auto-run prompt due to reliability issues. Auto-run has been disabled for all users who previously enabled it\n\nImprovements (4)\n\n- We've moved \"reject all diffs\" from Cmd+Backspace (⌘⌫) to Cmd+Shift+Backspace (⌘⇧⌫)\n- MCP on Windows should now be significantly more reliable\n- Improved MCP error messages when configuring MCP servers to assist with debugging\n- Added input token count for chat messages (click the three dots to view). We're continuing to improve context visibility so you can clearly see what gets sent to the model, expect more soon!\n\nPatches (9)\n\n- 0.48.1 - New onboarding\n- 0.48.2 - Allows users to accept/reject file edited in another chat tab\n- 0.48.3 - Chat Tabs UX improvements (Cmd/Ctrl+T for new tab), Max-mode support for Gemini 2.5 Pro\n- 0.48.4 - Image support for Gemini 2.5 Pro\n- 0.48.5 - Change management for Cmd+Backspace -> Cmd+Shift+Backspace\n- 0.48.6 - Creates a new chat after the AI Pane has been closed for long enough\n- 0.48.7 - Fixes an issue where some chats could get deleted on update\n- 0.48.8 - Improves CPU performance from @-symbols search\n- 0.48.9 - Lower memory usage from indexing\n\nPage 1 of 37\n\n[Next](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/2)",
