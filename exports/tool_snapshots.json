Agents can read the thread, understand what's going on, and create PRs in GitHub, all without leaving the conversation.\n\n### Use Cursor where your team works\n\nMention **@Cursor** in any thread with a prompt like:\n\n![Using @Cursor in Slack](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslack-zoomed.4d0262cc.gif&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAgents run remotely in a secure environment and you'll get updates directly in Slack, including links to Cursor and GitHub, when the work is done.\n\n### Agents understand context\n\nCursor reads the entire Slack thread before starting, so Background Agents understand the full context when you reference previous discussions or issues.\n\n![View PR link in Slack](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslack-view-pr.05c38101.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nYou can also ask Cursor to investigate issues and get answers:\n\n![Cursor agent investigating in Slack](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fslack-investigate.2320d781.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Getting started\n\nTo use Background Agents in Slack, an admin needs to set up the integration first. Check out our [setup documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/slack) or ask your workspace admin to connect Cursor from the [Dashboard → Integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations) page.\n\nOnce connected, try it in any channel with **@Cursor** and write a prompt. Use the command `help` to see all commands, or `settings` to configure your default model, repo, and branch.\n\nImprovements (1)\n\n- Search in settings with `Cmd/Ctrl+F`\n\nMCP (3)\n\n- Progress notifications from servers\n- Dynamic tool registration\n- Roots supports\n\nPatches (3)\n\n**1.1.1**\n\n- Fixed workspaces indexing issue\n\n**1.1.2**\n\n- Improved client side performance\n\n**1.1.3**\n\n- Fixed MCP performance regression\n- Added PR search and indexing\n- Improved deeplink experience\n- Added option to change upstream marketplace provider\n\n**1.1.4**\n\n- Improved Background Agent reliability\n- Fixed search in Chat UI bug\n\n**1.1.5**\n\n- Small performance improvements\n\n**1.1.6**\n\n- Fixed an agent latency regression that occurs for users using Remote SSH\n\n1.0\n\nJune 4, 2025\n\n1.0\n\n## [BugBot, Background Agent access to everyone, and one-click MCP install](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/1-0)\n\nCursor 1.0 is here!\n\nThis release brings BugBot for code review, a first look at memories, one-click MCP setup, Jupyter support, and general availability of Background Agent.\n\n### Automatic code review with BugBot\n\nBugBot automatically reviews your PRs and catches potential bugs and issues.\n\nWhen an issue is found, BugBot leaves a comment on your PRs in GitHub. You can click \" _**Fix in Cursor**_\" to move back to the editor with a pre-filled prompt to fix the issue.\n\nTo set it up, follow instructions in our [BugBot docs](https://docs.cursor.com/bugbot).\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Background Agent for everyone\n\nSince we released Background Agent, our remote coding agent, in early access a few weeks ago, early signals have been positive.\n\nWe're now excited to expand Background Agent to all users! You can start using it right away by clicking the cloud icon in chat or hitting `Cmd/Ctrl+E` if you have privacy mode disabled. For users with privacy mode enabled, we'll soon have a way to enable it for you too!\n\n![Background Agent in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fbg-agent.349d715a.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Agent in Jupyter Notebooks\n\nCursor can now implement changes in Jupyter Notebooks!\n\nAgent will now create and edit multiple cells directly inside of Jupyter, a significant improvement for research and data science tasks. Only supported with Sonnet models to start.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Memories\n\nWith Memories, Cursor can remember facts from conversations and reference them in the future. Memories are stored per project on an individual level, and can be managed from Settings.\n\nWe're rolling out Memories as a beta feature. To get started, enable from Settings → Rules.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### MCP one-click install and OAuth support\n\nYou can now set up MCP servers in Cursor with one click, and together with OAuth support, you can easily authenticate servers that support it.\n\nWe've curated a short list of official MCP servers you can add to Cursor at [docs.cursor.com/tools](https://docs.cursor.com/tools).\n\nIf you're an MCP developer, you can easily make your server available to developers by adding a _Add to Cursor_ button in your documentation and READMEs. Generate one at [docs.cursor.com/deeplinks](https://docs.cursor.com/deeplinks).\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Richer Chat responses\n\nCursor can now render visualizations inside of a conversation. In particular, Mermaid diagrams and Markdown tables can now be generated and viewed in the same place!\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### New Settings and Dashboard\n\nThe setting and dashboard page have gotten some polish with this release.\n\nWith the new Dashboard, you can view your individual or team's usage analytics, update your display name, and view detailed statistics broken down by tool or model.\n\n![Settings in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsettings.2dea9c3d.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![Dashboard in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdashboard.2b7002bf.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nKeyboard (1)\n\n- Open Background Agent control panel with `Cmd/Ctrl+E`\n\nImprovements (4)\n\n- `@Link` and web search can now parse PDFs and include in context\n- Network diagnostics in settings to verify connectivity\n- Faster responses with parallel tool calls\n- Collapsable tool calls in Chat\n\nAccount (3)\n\n- Enterprise users can only access stable release (no pre-release)\n- Team admins can now disable Privacy Mode\n- [Admin API for teams](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/admin-api) to access usage metrics and spend data\n\nModels (1)\n\n- Max mode is now available for Gemini 2.5 Flash\n\nPatches (1)\n\n**1.0.1**\n\n- Fixes and improvements to Background Agent\n\n0.50\n\nMay 15, 2025\n\n0.50\n\n## [Simplified Pricing, Background Agent and Refreshed Inline Edit](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/0-50)\n\nIntroducing unified request-based pricing, Max Mode for all top models, and Background Agent for parallel task execution. Plus, improved context management with `@folders` support, refreshed Inline Edit with new options, faster file edits, multi-root workspace support, and enhanced chat features including export and duplication.\n\n### Simpler, unified pricing\n\nWe've heard your feedback and are rolling out a unified pricing model to make it less confusing. Here's how it works:\n\n- All model usage is now unified into request-based pricing\n- Max mode now uses token-based pricing (similar to how models API pricing works)\n- Premium tool calls and long context mode are removed to keep it simple\n\nQuotas on [plans](https://www.cursor.com/pricing) Hobby, Pro and Business has not changed and slow requests are still included in the plans. All usage can be found in your [dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard) to help you track and manage your spend.\n\n### Max Mode for all top models\n\nMax Mode is now available for all state-of-the-art models in Cursor, with a simpler token-based pricing model. It's designed to give you full control when you need it most. You can enable it from the model picker to see which models support it. When new models roll out, Max Mode will be how we deliver their full capabilities from day one.\n\nIt's ideal for your hardest problems when you need more context, intelligence and tool use. For everything else, normal mode is still recommended with the same capabilities you're used to.\n\nThe pricing is straightforward: you're charged based on token usage. If you've used any CLI-based coding tool, Max mode will feel like that - but right in Cursor.\n\n> Note: If you're using an older version of Cursor, you'll still have access to the previous MAX versions and long context mode for a few weeks. However, these features will be sunset soon, so we recommend updating to continue using these capabilities.\n\nRead more about Max Mode in our [documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/max-mode)\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### New Tab model\n\nWe've trained a new Tab model that now can suggest changes across multiple files. The model excels particularly at refactors, edit chains, multi file changes, and jumping between related code. You'll also notice it feels more natural and snappier in day-to-day use.\n\nWith this we've also added syntax highlighting to the completion suggestions.\n\n![New Tab model in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftab-jump.d0319f16.png&w=2880&q=75)\n\n### Background Agent  Preview\n\nIn early preview, rolling out gradually: Cursor agents can now run in the background! To try it, head to Settings > Beta > Background Agent.\n\nThis allows you to run many agents in parallel and have them tackle bigger tasks. The agents run in their own remote environments. At any point, you can view the status, send a follow-up, or take over.\n\nWe're curious to hear what you think. While it is still early, we've found background agents useful internally for fixing nits, doing investigations, and writing first drafts of medium-sized PRs. Read more at [docs.cursor.com/background-agent](https://docs.cursor.com/background-agent).\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Include your entire codebase in context\n\nYou can now use `@folders` to add your entire codebase into context, just make sure to enable `Full folder contents` from settings. If a folder (or file) is too large to be included, you'll see a small icon on the context pill indicating this.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Refreshed Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K) with Agent integration\n\nInline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K) has gotten a UI refresh and new options for full file edits (⌘⇧⏎) and sending to agent (⌘L)\n\nFull file makes it easy to do scope changes to a file without using agent. However, you might come across cases where you're working with a piece of code you want to make multi-file edits to or simply just want more control you can get from agent. That's when you want to send selected codeblock to agent and keep on editing from there.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Fast edits for long files with Agent\n\nWe've added a new tool to the agent that will search & replace code in files, making it much more efficient for long files. Instead of reading the complete file, Agent can now find the exact place where edits should occur and change only that part. Here's an example editing a file in [Postgres codebase](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/tcop/postgres.c) where using search & replace tool is nearly double as fast. We're rolling this out to Anthropic models first and will expand to other models soon.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Work in multiple codebases with workspaces\n\nNow you can create multi-root workspaces to make multiple codebases available to Cursor. All of them will be indexed and available to Cursor, ideal when you have projects in different folders you want to work on in the same space.\n\n`.cursor/rules` are supported in all folders added\n\n![Multi-root workspaces in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fworkspace.90fbcb7b.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Working with Chat\n\n#### Exporting Chat\n\nYou can now export chats to markdown from the chat view. Text and code blocks are included in the final export.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n#### Duplicate Chats\n\nExploring different paths from a conversation while preserving the existing is now possible with chat duplication. Go to a message and start a new chat from the three dots menu.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nKeybindings (1)\n\n- Full file edits from Inline Edit: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+K`\n\nImprovements (11)\n\n- Agent now uses native terminal emulation instead of simulated terminals\n- `@folders` will now try to include all files that fit in context\n- Icons for context state in Chat to tell you if files were not included or condensed\n- Individual MCP tools can now be disabled from MCP settings\n- New C# extension available in marketplace\n- Chat font size can now be increased in settings\n- Detailed in-app changelog\n\n**MCP**\n\n- Run stdio from remote workspace (WSL, Remote SSH)\n- Streamable HTTP support\n- Fixed leaking SSE server connections\n- More reliable refreshing when changing config\n\nAccount (1)\n\n- Removed 10 free requests/day for Claude 3 Opus\n\nPatches (7)\n\n**0.50.1**\n\n- Background Agent availability\n\n**0.50.2**\n\n- Fixed keyboard navigation in Jupyter notebooks\n- Fixed Custom mode models MAX and selection issues\n- Improved indexing reliability for single-root workspaces\n- Fixed VPN reliability with ZScaler\n\n**0.50.3**\n\n- Performance improvements\n\n**0.50.4**\n\n- Improved apply reliability\n- Fixed Windows horizontal scrolling bug\n- MCP improvements\n- Improved multiroot workspace support\n\n**0.50.5**\n\n- Fixed chat pill not updating when switching files\n\n**0.50.6**\n\n- Fixed search & replace reliability issues\n- Fixed checkpoint reliability issues\n- Improved indexing\n- Improved Python extension\n\n**0.50.7**\n\n- Fixed search & replace bug for Windows\n\n0.49\n\nApril 15, 2025\n\n0.49\n\n## [Rules generation, improved agent terminal and MCP images](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/0-49)\n\n### Automated and improved rules\n\nYou can now generate rules directly from a conversation using the `/Generate Cursor Rules` command. This is useful when you want to capture the existing context of a conversation to reuse later.\n\nFor `Auto Attached` rules with path patterns defined, Agent will now automatically apply the right rules when reading or writing files\n\nWe’ve also fixed a long-standing issue where `Always` attached rules now persist across longer conversations. Agent can now also edit rules reliably.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### More accessible history\n\nChat history has moved into the command palette. You can access it from the \"Show history button\" in Chat as well as through the `Show Chat History` command\n\n![Chat history](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchat-history.99f0dd79.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Making reviews easier\n\nReviewing agent generated code is now easier with a built-in diff view at the end of each conversation. You'll find the `Review changes` button at the bottom of chat after a message from the agent.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Images in MCP\n\nYou can now pass images as part of the context in MCP servers. This helps when screenshots, UI mocks, or diagrams add essential context to a question or prompt.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Improved agent terminal control\n\nWe've added more control for you over terminals started by the agent. Commands can now be edited before they run, or skipped entirely. We've also renamed \"Pop-out\" to \"Move to background\" to better reflect what it does.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Global ignore files\n\nYou can now define [global ignore](https://docs.cursor.com/context/ignore-files) patterns that apply across all projects via your user-level settings. This keeps noisy or sensitive files like build outputs or secrets out of prompts, without needing per-project configuration.\n\n![Global ignore files](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fignore-files.f9e4d0f0.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### New models\n\nWe've recently added many more [models](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models) you can use. Try out Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, GPT-4.1, o3 and o4-mini from model settings.\n\n![Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgemini-2.5.8414d83f.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![Grok 3](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgrok-3.5db31a7e.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![GPT-4.1](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgpt-4.1.cfcf0933.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![o3 & o4-mini](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fo3-o4-mini.607b4179.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Project structure in context  Beta\n\nWe’re introducing an option to include project structure in context, which adds your directory structure to the prompt. The agent now gets a clearer sense of how your project is organized, which improves suggestions and navigation of large or nested monorepos.\n\nKeybindings (2)\n\n- Some `CMD+K` shortcuts are now remappable\n- Emacs keybinding extensions now work reliably\n\nImprovements (5)\n\n- Simplified model picker UI for Auto-select\n- New interface for command palette\n- Refreshed UI for Tab jump suggestions. Suggestions outside viewport are now clickable\n- Tooltips for modes in Chat\n- MCP stability\n- You can now connect to AWS Bedrock using access keys and secret keys\n- Git > @PR has now been renamed to @Branch\n\nFixes (4)\n\n- Always-attached rules now persist correctly across summarization\n- Rules in `.mdc` files can now be created and edited without issue by agent\n- Fixed selection issues with `@mention` nodes at the start of the input box\n- Performance in core editor\n\nBusiness / Teams (4)\n\n**Global ignore traversal**\n\n- Cursor can now traverse up directory trees to find ignore files. This behavior is off by default and can be enabled from admin settings.\n\n**IAM roles for Bedrock**\n\n- Enterprises can now connect to AWS Bedrock using IAM roles\n\n**User-level usage insights**\n\n- Admins can now view per-user spend and fast request usage directly from the dashboard.\n\n**Auto-run controls for teams**\n\n- Admins can configure global MCP settings from dashboard.\n\nPatches (6)\n\n**0.49.1**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Fixed Cursor Rules editor for Remote SSH\n- Fixed UI delimiter display in zsh terminal in Chat\n- Fixed \"max length\" warning showing incorrectly for rules under size limit\n- Fixed \"message too large\" warning appearing in empty chats\n\n**0.49.2**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Improved rule generation apply\n- Improved caching for user prompts\n- Improved client metric handling\n\n**0.49.3**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Fixed issue with loading chat\n\n**0.49.4**\n\nPrerelease\n\n- Fixed Neovim chat keybindings\n- Improved indexing debug logs\n- Fixed `.cursorignore` issue preventing chat submission on Windows\n\n**0.49.5**\n\n- Improved client reliability\n\n**0.49.6**\n\n- Fixed possibly broken codeblocks in old chats\n- Fixed loading state issue in old chats\n- Fixed chat message rendering issue\n- Improved folders parsing\n\n0.48.x\n\nMarch 23, 2025\n\n0.48.x\n\n## [Chat tabs, Custom modes & Faster indexing](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/chat-tabs-custom-modes-sound-notification)\n\nThis release introduces chat tabs for parallel conversations, a redesigned\nmodes system with custom modes, and improvements to cost visibility, indexing\nperformance, and MCP reliability. Additionally, a sound notification plays when a chat is finished\n\n### Built-in modes & custom modes (beta)\n\nAgent and Ask modes are the built-in modes in Cursor, now with the option to add custom modes. We've also renamed \"Edit\" to \"Manual\" to better reflect its behavior.\n\nAsk mode now has access to all search tools by default, so the `@Codebase` tool has been removed. It will automatically search the codebase when needed. If you want to force a search, simply ask Cursor in natural language to \"search the codebase\". You can disable search from Ask in the mode menu, which will result in Ask only seeing the context you have provided.\n\nRead more about [Agent](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent) and [Ask](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/ask).\n\n![Modes](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmodes.e9d94bd5.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Custom modes** (beta) allow you to compose new modes with tools and prompts that fit your workflow. Since custom modes can have custom keybindings, **⌘I will default to Agent mode** and **⌘L** will toggle the side pane. If you unbind ⌘I, it will also toggle the side pane. Custom modes are currently in beta, and you can enable them from Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes.\n\nYou can also set the default mode from settings (Settings → Features → Chat → Default chat mode) to one of your modes or to the one you used most recently.\n\nRead more about [custom modes](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes).\n\n![custom modes](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcustom-modes.ea111789.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Chat tabs\n\nCreate new tabs (⌘T) in chat to have multiple conversations in parallel. You can also hold Option and click the + button to create a new tab. Cmd+N still creates a new chat in the current tab\n\nWhen a tab is awaiting your input, you'll see an orange dot on that tab.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n### Faster indexing\n\nWe've made significant improvements to indexing performance of similar codebases within a team, greatly reducing the initial indexing time for subsequent copies of large repositories after one copy has been fully indexed. For example, the Cursor codebase now indexes in under a minute, previously taking around 20 minutes.\n\n### Sound notification (beta)\n\nCursor can now play a sound when a chat is ready for review. Enable this feature from Settings → Features → Chat → Play sound on finish.\n\n### Usage-based cost visibility\n\nFor usage-based models, you can now view the cost and breakdown per chat from the history.\n\n![Cost visibility](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchat-cost.a1f3f4d2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### New onboarding\n\nWe've introduced an easier onboarding process to help you get started with Cursor. You'll be guided through importing settings, selecting themes, keybindings, and other preferences.\n\n![onboarding](https://www.cursor.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fonboarding.5ec6e148.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOther (6)\n\n- Improved indexing performance for teams sharing codebases\n- The vertical sidebar option will temporarily be unavailable for users who opted into Early Access\n- Projects with MCP servers will now prompt users to enable them\n- Chat will now display a notification about usage-based pricing when approaching fast request or usage limits\n- Enhanced visibility of auto-run controls configured by team admins, clarifying when they are active\n- Removed auto-run prompt due to reliability issues. Auto-run has been disabled for all users who previously enabled it\n\nImprovements (4)\n\n- We've moved \"reject all diffs\" from Cmd+Backspace (⌘⌫) to Cmd+Shift+Backspace (⌘⇧⌫)\n- MCP on Windows should now be significantly more reliable\n- Improved MCP error messages when configuring MCP servers to assist with debugging\n- Added input token count for chat messages (click the three dots to view). We're continuing to improve context visibility so you can clearly see what gets sent to the model, expect more soon!\n\nPatches (9)\n\n- 0.48.1 - New onboarding\n- 0.48.2 - Allows users to accept/reject file edited in another chat tab\n- 0.48.3 - Chat Tabs UX improvements (Cmd/Ctrl+T for new tab), Max-mode support for Gemini 2.5 Pro\n- 0.48.4 - Image support for Gemini 2.5 Pro\n- 0.48.5 - Change management for Cmd+Backspace -> Cmd+Shift+Backspace\n- 0.48.6 - Creates a new chat after the AI Pane has been closed for long enough\n- 0.48.7 - Fixes an issue where some chats could get deleted on update\n- 0.48.8 - Improves CPU performance from @-symbols search\n- 0.48.9 - Lower memory usage from indexing\n\nPage 1 of 37\n\n[Next](https://www.cursor.com/changelog/2)",

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.\n\nGitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.\n\nGitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.\n\n#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?\n\nGitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.\n\n#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?\n\nGitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.\n\nGitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?\n\nNo, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.\n\n- When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\n\n- To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\n\n- To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\n\n- To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\n\n\n#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?\n\nGitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\nOrganizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.\n\nGitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\n#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?\n\nGitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.\n\n#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?\n\nGitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).\n\n#### What if I do not want GitHub Copilot?\n\nGitHub Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types GitHub Copilot is active for.\n\n#### How do I control access to GitHub Copilot in my company?\n\nAccess to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set GitHub Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).\n\n#### Plans & pricing\n\n#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?\n\nGitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\nOrganizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.\n\nGitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\n#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?\n\nIf you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).\n\n#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?\n\nGitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).\n\n#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?\n\nGitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.\n\n#### Privacy\n\n#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?\n\nGitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:\n\n- **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.\n\n- **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.\n\n- **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.\n\n- **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.\n\n\n#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?\n\nNo. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.\n\n#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?\n\nHow GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:\n\n- Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\n\n- Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\n\n- Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\n\n\nThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( [DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.\n\nGitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:\n\n- Billing and account management\n\n- To comply with and resolve legal obligations\n\n- For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\n\n- To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\n\n- To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\n\n\nFor details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).\n\n#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?\n\nIf and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:\n\n**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**\n\n- Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained\n\n- User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\n\n- Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\n\n\n**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**\n\n- Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.\n\n- User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\n\n- Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\n\n\n#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?\n\nRetaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?\n\nYes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\n\nWhile we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.\n\n#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?\n\nThese actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).\n\n#### Responsible AI\n\n#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?\n\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:\n\nCopyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.\n\nWhat about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.\n\nOur experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.\n\nIn Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \" [Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code)\". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?\n\nYes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.\n\n- GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\n\n- With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\n\n- In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\n\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?\n\nYes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.\n\n#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?\n\nWe don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).\n\n- If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\n\n- GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\n\n\n#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?\n\nPublic code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.\n\n#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?\n\nNo. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.\n\n- The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\n\n- Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.\n\n\n#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?\n\nNot necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.\n\n- As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.\n\n- Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.\n\n- You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.\n\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?\n\nWe are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?\n\nGitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to [copilot-safety@github.com](mailto:copilot-safety@github.com) so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.\n\n#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?\n\nGiven public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.\n\n#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?\n\nGitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.\n\n1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).\n\n2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.\n\n3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.\n\n\nGeneralPlans & pricingPrivacyResponsible AI\n\n### General\n\n#### What is GitHub Copilot?\n\nGitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.\n\nGitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.\n\nGitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.\n\n#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?\n\nGitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.\n\n#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?\n\nGitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.\n\nGitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?\n\nNo, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.\n\n- When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\n\n- To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\n\n- To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\n\n- To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\n\n\n#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?\n\nGitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\nOrganizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.\n\nGitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\n#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?\n\nGitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.\n\n#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?\n\nGitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).\n\n#### What if I do not want GitHub Copilot?\n\nGitHub Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types GitHub Copilot is active for.\n\n#### How do I control access to GitHub Copilot in my company?\n\nAccess to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set GitHub Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).\n\n### Plans & pricing\n\n#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?\n\nGitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\nOrganizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.\n\nGitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\n#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?\n\nIf you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).\n\n#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?\n\nGitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).\n\n#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?\n\nGitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.\n\n### Privacy\n\n#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?\n\nGitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:\n\n- **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.\n\n- **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.\n\n- **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.\n\n- **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.\n\n\n#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?\n\nNo. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.\n\n#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?\n\nHow GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:\n\n- Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\n\n- Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\n\n- Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\n\n\nThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( [DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.\n\nGitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:\n\n- Billing and account management\n\n- To comply with and resolve legal obligations\n\n- For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\n\n- To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\n\n- To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\n\n\nFor details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).\n\n#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?\n\nIf and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:\n\n**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**\n\n- Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained\n\n- User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\n\n- Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\n\n\n**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**\n\n- Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.\n\n- User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\n\n- Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\n\n\n#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?\n\nRetaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?\n\nYes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\n\nWhile we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.\n\n#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?\n\nThese actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).\n\n### Responsible AI\n\n#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?\n\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:\n\nCopyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.\n\nWhat about copyright risk in suggestions?

If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?\n\nYes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.\n\n- GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\n\n- With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\n\n- In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\n\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?\n\nYes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.\n\n- As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.\n\n- Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.\n\n- You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.\n\n\n#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?\n\nWe are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers.
